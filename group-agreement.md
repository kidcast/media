# Group Agreement

## Communication Plan

* GitHub Project for tasks
* Slack for quick communication of ideas
* If a team member can't meet in person, they can resort to Slack or skype/facetime
* If a team member is feeling overwhelmed, notify team so that others can support
* If a team member is ahead of task/schedule, notify team to help with other tasks
* Constant agreement on task deadlines

## Conflict Plan

* Resolving issues begins with original individuals, with additional team members/people becoming involved only if issue is not resolved between original individuals.

* Conflict Hierarchy: Team Members --> Additional Team Members --> TA's --> Instructor

## Work Plan (Primary: GitHub Project)


* Identifying Tasks:

* Mob-coding for initial build out and then splitting tasks out after that
 
* Assigning Tasks:
  * Team members will choose tasks as they are created such that each member is getting a fair share of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript use
  * Individual Contribution Tracking: GitHub Project branch commits

* Deadlines/Task Completion:
  * Notify team in GitHub Project and Slack when a task is complete or more time needed

* Task Management:
  * Goal - 1 task complete per day
  * Goal - merge any/all progress at end of each day as a team 


## Git Process

* One additional team member must review any pull request before merging
* Availability (first to respond) can determine who reviews and submits merge

## Additional

* Open to various physical locations and alternate meeting times to accommodate everyone's schedule
* Make sure all team members are getting periods of mental recovery/relaxation
